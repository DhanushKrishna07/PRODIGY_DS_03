This is task 3 of Prodigy InfoTech | Data Science Domain.

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

 ðŸš€Enhancing Customer Deposit Predictions with Decision TreesðŸš€
 
Delved into customer deposit predictions using the bank dataset. Utilized Decision Trees to uncover insights, enhanced model accuracy with pruning techniques, and visualized the decision-making process.

Project Highlights:

â€¢Built and trained a Decision Tree model to predict customer deposits.
â€¢Enhanced the model using pruning to prevent overfitting.
â€¢Achieved and compared accuracy before and after pruning.
â€¢Visualized both the initial and pruned Decision Trees for better interpretability.

Steps Involved:

â€¢ Imported essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
â€¢ Loaded the dataset containing customer information.
â€¢ Preprocessed the data by dropping the target column and applying one-hot encoding to categorical variables.
â€¢ Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
â€¢ Built and trained the initial Decision Tree classifier.
â€¢ Made predictions and calculated accuracy for the initial model.
â€¢ Visualized the initial Decision Tree to understand its structure.
â€¢ Created and trained a pruned Decision Tree classifier to enhance performance.
â€¢ Made predictions and calculated accuracy for the pruned model.
â€¢ Visualized the pruned Decision Tree to compare with the initial model.

Key Takeaway:

Pruning significantly enhances the performance of a Decision Tree model by reducing overfitting, resulting in more accurate predictions and clearer insights into customer deposit behavior.
